## Problem Domain

**Problem Statement:**
Many users struggle to manage their tasks, projects, and deadlines efficiently. Existing task management tools are either too generic, overly complex, or fail to provide meaningful ways to organize and track progress. Common challenges include:  

- Losing track of multiple tasks and deadlines  
- Difficulty managing projects with multiple steps or sub-tasks  
- Hard to get a clear overview of workload at a glance  
- Lack of motivation or feedback to complete tasks on time  
---

# Team-Rules
1. **Clear and consistent communication** is essential for team success.  
2. The **team leader will update the team project page weekly**, and **each team member is responsible for updating their individual progress page weekly**.   
3. **Each team member will work on their own Git branch**. Once a feature is complete, the member will **open a pull request**, which will be **tested and reviewed by the team leader** before merging.  
4. **All team members are expected to document their work clearly**, including meaningful commit messages and brief descriptions of changes, to ensure transparency and smooth collaboration.
